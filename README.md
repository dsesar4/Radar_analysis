# Radar analysis

Simply written script for analysing radars available for central Croatia and Slavonia. If needed, it can be relocated to somewhere else. Parameters are inserted when script is started. Great for post-analysis for any kind of weather (winter cyclones, summer storms or frontogenesis...).

Jupyter Notebook available for detailed explanations.
