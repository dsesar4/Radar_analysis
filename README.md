# Radar analysis

Simply written script for analysing DHMZ Bilogora doppler radar for central Croatia. If needed, it can be relocated to somewhere else. Only starting time and number of frames needs to be inserted. Great for post-analysis, especially for stormy days because it shows where exactly and how many times each type of storm was tracked.

Jupyter Notebook available for detailed explanations.
