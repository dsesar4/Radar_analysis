# Radar analysis

Script for analysing weather radars available for central Croatia and Slavonia. If needed, it can be relocated to somewhere else within radar range. Geo and time parameters are inserted when script is started (run with template file in the same folder). Great for post-analysis for any kind of weather (winter cyclones, summer storms or frontogenesis...).
