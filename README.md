# Radar analysis

Since there are multiple high-quality weather radars available for much of Croatia, tool for their post analysis is required. For example, plotting how many 30-40 dBz reflections were present in certain time interval on certain area can be very useful when determining various weather patters.

There are 3 radars included, each has its own script:

1. ARSO Lisca - old and new version
2. DHMZ Bilogora
3. DHMZ Osijek

Lisca can be used for much of central, mountainous and north Adriatic Croatia. 

Bilogora can be used for central and mountainous Croatia.

Osijek can be used for various parts of Slavonia.

Each script is started separately and is run on its own. All of data is manually inserted after script run command. There are multiple options for various parts of Croatia. Only requirement is that template picture is in the same folder as script.

Don't overabuse and enjoy! :)
